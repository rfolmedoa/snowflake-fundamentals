-- 11.0.0  Snowflake Functions
--         Expect this lab to take approximately 15 minutes.
--         Snowflake has a large built-in library of functions. In this lab you
--         will get the opportunity to work with some of them.

-- 11.1.0  Scalar Functions

-- 11.1.1  Open a worksheet and name it Functions and set the context:

USE ROLE TRAINING_ROLE;
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS COBRA_WH;
USE WAREHOUSE COBRA_WH;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS COBRA_DB;
USE COBRA_DB.PUBLIC;

ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;


-- 11.1.2  Run the statement below to convert c_name to uppercase.

SELECT c_name, UPPER(c_name) 
    FROM "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1"."CUSTOMER";


-- 11.1.3  Run the following statements using the conditional function IFF to
--         see what it does:

SELECT  
    o_orderkey,
    o_totalprice,
    o_orderpriority,
    IFF(o_orderpriority like '1-URGENT', o_totalprice * 0.01, o_totalprice * 0.005)::number(16,2)       ShippingCost  
FROM "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1"."ORDERS";


-- 11.1.4  Use a CASE expression to print out text for preferred customer:

SELECT (c_salutation || ' ' || c_first_name || ' ' || c_last_name) AS full_name,
    CASE
        WHEN c_preferred_cust_flag LIKE 'Y'
            THEN 'Preferred Customer'
        WHEN c_preferred_cust_flag LIKE 'N'
            THEN 'Not Preferred Customer'
        END AS customer_status
FROM "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCDS_SF100TCL"."CUSTOMER"
LIMIT 100;


-- 11.1.5  Use the following statements to generate data. Note that random()
--         with no argument generates a different number every time. If you
--         provide a seed value, for example, random(12), the same value will be
--         returned every time:

SELECT RANDOM() AS random_variable;

SELECT RANDOM(100) AS random_fixed;


-- 11.1.6  Run this query to use some time and date functions:

SELECT CURRENT_DATE(), DATE_PART('DAY', CURRENT_DATE()), CURRENT_TIME();


-- 11.1.7  Snowflake has many string functions. Here is one you can run:

SELECT STRTOK_TO_ARRAY(query_text)
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_text LIKE 'select%'
AND query_text NOT LIKE 'select 1%'
LIMIT 5;


-- 11.1.8  Run this statement to change an array back to a string with a
--         separator:

SELECT STRTOK_TO_ARRAY(query_text),
       ARRAY_TO_STRING(STRTOK_TO_ARRAY(query_text),'#')
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_text LIKE 'select%'
AND query_text NOT LIKE 'select 1%'
LIMIT 5;


-- 11.2.0  Use Regular and Windows Aggregate Functions
--         Aggregate functions work across rows to perform mathematical
--         functions such as MIN, MAX, COUNT, and a variety of statistical
--         functions.
--         Many of the aggregate functions can work with the OVER clause
--         enabling aggregations across a group of rows. This is called a WINDOW
--         function. This capability was shown earlier.
--         In this section you will work with some of the aggregate window
--         functions.

-- 11.2.1  Use WINDOW aggregate functions:

SELECT DAYOFMONTH(start_time), start_time, end_time,  warehouse_name, credits_used, SUM(credits_used)
    OVER (PARTITION BY DAYOFMONTH(start_time), warehouse_name
    ORDER BY DAYOFMONTH(start_time), warehouse_name )
AS day_tot_credits
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
    ORDER BY warehouse_name;


-- 11.2.2  Query the query history to produce numeric aggregates on query total
--         times:

SELECT MONTH(qh.start_time) AS "month", DAYOFMONTH(qh.start_time) AS dom,
qh.warehouse_name,
AVG(qh.total_elapsed_time),
MIN(qh.total_elapsed_time),
MAX(qh.total_elapsed_time),
STDDEV(qh.total_elapsed_time)
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY qh
WHERE query_text LIKE 'select%'
AND query_text NOT LIKE 'select 1%'
GROUP BY "month", dom, qh.warehouse_name
ORDER BY "month", dom, qh.warehouse_name;


-- 11.3.0  Use TABLE and System Functions
--         Table functions return a set of rows instead of a single scalar
--         value. Table functions appear in the FROM clause of a SQL statement
--         and cannot be used as scalar functions.

-- 11.3.1  Use a table function to retrieve 1 hour of query history:

SELECT * FROM TABLE(information_schema.query_history
      (DATEADD('hours', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()))
ORDER BY start_time;


-- 11.3.2  Use the RESULT_SCAN function to return the last result set:

SELECT * FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(LAST_QUERY_ID()));


-- 11.3.3  Use the SHOW command with the RESULT_SCAN function to have SQL
--         generate a list of commands to describe tables:

SHOW TABLES;
SELECT CONCAT('DESC ',"name",';')
FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(LAST_QUERY_ID()));


-- 11.3.4  Note that Snowflakeâ€™s SQL is generally case-insensitive: it changes
--         everything to upper case unless it is enclosed in quotes. In this
--         example, the name column must be lower case, so it is quoted.

-- 11.3.5  Use the SYSTEM$WHITELIST function to see information on hosts that
--         should be unblocked for Snowflake to work. Click on the item in the
--         first row to see what the column contains:

SELECT SYSTEM$WHITELIST();


-- 11.3.6  For an easier-to-read version, use the FLATTEN table function to
--         flatten the data, which is in a semi-structured format:

SELECT VALUE:type AS type,
       VALUE:host AS host,
       VALUE:port AS port
FROM TABLE(FLATTEN(INPUT => PARSE_JSON(system$whitelist())));


-- 11.3.7  Suspend and resize the warehouse

ALTER WAREHOUSE COBRA_WH SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE=XSmall;
ALTER WAREHOUSE COBRA_WH SUSPEND;
